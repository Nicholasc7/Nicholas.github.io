          <h2>What is Montana all about?</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Montana, also known as the "Big Sky Country" is one of the most scenic and serene landscapes in all of North America. It has seen a very recent boom in it's population due to many people moving in from California. The beautful state is a
          treasure for many outdoor enthusiasts or for people who just want to live a quiet life away from the city. With such a low cost of living in contrast to the rest more heavily populated states it's a great option for people looking to save
          money too! Here are some key features of the state.

        <p class="text-spacing">
          The mighty and strong <strong>Grizzly Bear</strong> is the state animal of Montana. Their presence alone can bring fear to many hiker and campers. They can reach heights up to eight feet tall and weigh up to 800 pounds. They are among the
          largest omnivores in North America. Grizzlies have large populations in Glacier National Park and the greater Yellowstone ecosystem, but their territory also stretches into Idaho, Washington, and Wyoming.

        <h2>Montana's Fastest Growing City</h2>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p class="text-spacing"><em>Bozeman</em> is the fastest growing city in Montana. Bozeman, Montana, is a scenic little town with a population of just under 49,000, nestled in the Rocky Mountains. It is often described as a sleepy outdoor paradise with excellent
          food. It has not only been ranked the fastest-growing city of its size in the nation, but it's also becoming a tech hub that's attracting pioneering millennials from around the country. In fact, it's often somewhat disparagingly called "Boz
          Angeles" for the many Californians and celebrities that have come to town, as well as its perceived "fanciness" in relation to the rest of the state. </p>

        <h2>Largest Exports</h2>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p class="text-spacing">
          Montana's largest export are coal and copper. I guess you can say it's a rocky state.The Montana coal industry exists to support the generation of electricity. All but a tiny
          fraction of the coal mined in Montana eventually is converted to electricity. In recent years,
          over half the electricity generated in Montana has come from coal-fired plants. Almost
          three-quarters of the coal mined in the state are exported, primarily to Midwestern utilities.
          Even though new generating stations built around the country in recent years have relied on
          natural gas or wind, coal continues to provide half of the nationâ€™s electricity.
